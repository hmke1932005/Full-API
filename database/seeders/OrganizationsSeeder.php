-- The `universities` table previously had no seed rows —
-- UniversityRepository::getOrCreate() only creates an EMPTY row the first
-- time that portal is visited (name/location all blank), which is why a
-- fresh install shows an empty Settings form. This gives the demo account
-- (university@uip.demo, see users_seeder.sql) real
-- sample data, verified and public, so Settings, the new Portfolio
-- page, and the public share link (/u/{uuid}) all render
-- something meaningful immediately. Depends on users_seeder.sql having
-- run first, and must run BEFORE projects_seeder.sql — that seeder links
-- its one published demo project to this seeded university by lookup, so
-- the university row needs to already exist. Requires migration 040
-- (adds universities.is_public) to already be
-- applied.
